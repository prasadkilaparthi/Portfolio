This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and ESLint rules.

### Portfolio Link:

- You can view the live portfolio here: [Portfolio](https://portfolio-omega-kohl-97.vercel.app/)

### Official Plugins Used:

Currently, two official plugins are available for React development in Vite:

- **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**: Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**: Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

### Features:

- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A next-generation, fast build tool that provides an optimized developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for fast and responsive UI development.
- **ESLint**: Linting for maintaining code quality and consistency.
